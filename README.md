A basic recipe website to demonstrate skills in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)  and working with Git.

The skills:
 - Setting up boilerplate html (most commonly used elements across many webpages).
 - Using ol, ul, and li elements to create ordered and unordered lists.
 - Using anchor element to link to other webpages/documents on the website with relative link.
 - Using image element to provide visuals with an absolute link and "alt, width, height" attributes to support the img element. 
 - Using paragraph element and heading elements to provide text content and structure the pages neatly.
 - Using type, class, descendant combinator, and grouping selectors to apply styles to html elements.
 - Using properties such as color, background-color, font-size, font-family, font-weight, and text-align to change how typography is displayed.
 - Using display property to change the normal flow of the element (e.g. changing anchor element which is typically a inline element to a block element).
 - Setting the box-sizing property value to border-box accommodate for border and padding added to element without changing the width and height of the element.
 - Working with margin, border, and padding to place elements in the desired location on the webpage.
 - Adding external stylesheet to html document.  
 - Using git to control the workflow of the development process.
