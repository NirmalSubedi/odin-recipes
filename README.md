A basic recipe website to demonstrate skills in HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and working with Git.

The skills:
    - Setting up boilerplate html (most commonly used elements across many webpages).
    - Using ol, ul, and li elements to create ordered and unordered lists.
    - Using anchor element to link to other webpages/documents on the website with relative link.
    - Using image element to provide visuals with an absolute link and "alt, width, height" attributes to support the img element. 
    - Using paragraph element and heading elements to provide text content and structure the pages neatly.
    - Using git to control the workflow of the development process.
